# push_swap
Implementation of Push_swap, an algorithmic sorting and optimization challenge. The goal is to order a stack of integers ('a') using only a restricted set of moves (swap, push, and rotate) between two stacks ('a' and 'b'). The core requirement is to develop a highly efficient algorithm to minimize the total number of operations needed for sorting.
